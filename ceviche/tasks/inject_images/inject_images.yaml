    Analyze the content and available images from the images.md catalog. Insert relevant images using Markdown syntax where they can enhance understanding. Follow these guidelines:

    1. Images are documented in the catalog with:
       - Figure titles (## Figure1)
       - Image markdown: ![legenda](./images/figure1.jpg)
       - Detailed descriptions
    
    2. When inserting images:
       - Use the exact markdown syntax from the catalog
       - Change the path from ./images to ./../images
       - Keep the original legenda
       - Place images near relevant content
       - Maintain all original content
    
    3. Format Guidelines:
       - Original path: ![legenda](./images/figure1.jpg)
       - Modified path: ![legenda](./../images/figure1.jpg)
       - Place a blank line before and after each image
    
    4. Critical Error Prevention:
       - NEVER change image extensions (e.g., .jpg to .png)
       - ONLY use filenames exactly as they appear in the catalog
       - DO NOT invent or modify image filenames
       - DO NOT modify image paths except for changing ./images to ./../images
       - If unsure about an image reference, DO NOT include it
    
    5. Validation Steps:
       - Before inserting an image, verify it exists in the catalog
       - Confirm the exact filename and extension match the catalog
       - Double-check the path format follows the guidelines
       - Ensure the legenda matches the catalog entry
    
    6. Add <!-- END --> at the very end of the content

    Example Input Catalog:
    ## Figure1
    ![Architecture Diagram](./images/figure1.jpg)
    Shows the system architecture with components.

    ## Figure2
    ![Workflow Process](./images/figure2.jpg)
    Illustrates the data processing workflow.

    Example Input Content:
    "The system architecture consists of multiple components that work together. 
    The data processing follows a specific workflow to ensure accuracy."

    Example Correct Output:
    "The system architecture consists of multiple components that work together.

    ![Architecture Diagram](./../images/figure1.jpg)

    The data processing follows a specific workflow to ensure accuracy.

    ![Workflow Process](./../images/figure2.jpg)
    "

    Common Errors to Avoid:
    Input Content: "The architecture diagram shows the system components."

    ❌ WRONG: "The architecture diagram shows the system components.
    ![Architecture](./../images/architecture.jpg)"  # Invented filename

    ❌ WRONG: "The architecture diagram shows the system components.
    ![Architecture Diagram](./../images/figure1.png)"  # Wrong extension

    ✅ CORRECT: "The architecture diagram shows the system components.

    ![Architecture Diagram](./../images/figure1.jpg)

    - Use exact image markdown from the catalog, only changing ./images to ./../images
    - Place images near their contextual references
    - Preserve all original content
    - Never modify image extensions or filenames
    - Add <!-- END --> at the end
