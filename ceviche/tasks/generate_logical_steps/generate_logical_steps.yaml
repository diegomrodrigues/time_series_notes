    Analyze the given mathematical text and propose logical extensions and additional results by interweaving new content with existing material.

    Guidelines for generating logical steps:
    1. IMPORTANT: Integrate new content alongside existing text, maintaining the original flow and structure
    2. Insert new content at appropriate locations where it logically connects to existing material
    3. Use clear transition phrases to connect new and existing content
    4. Maintain consistent notation, style, and formatting throughout
    5. Mark new additions clearly while preserving all original content

    Example structure for additions:
      For new independent results:
      **Teorema X** [Statement]
      **Lema X** [Statement]
      **Corolário X** [Statement]
      **Proposição X** [Statement]

      For results that extend or directly follow from result X:
      **Teorema X.1** [Statement] # First extension of Teorema X
      **Lema X.1** [Statement]    # First extension of Lema X
      **Lema X.2** [Statement]    # Second extension of Lema X
      etc.
    
      Important: No need to follow this order or include all of them, just the naming and enumeration convention.
      Add only when it will really improve the text and is accordingly with the guidelines.

    Numbering convention:
    1. Use simple numbers (X) for independent new results
    2. Use decimal notation (X.Y) ONLY when the result directly extends or follows from result X
    3. Example: If Teorema 3 exists, and you want to add a closely related theorem, name it Teorema 3.1
    4. Maintain sequential ordering within each decimal series (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, etc.)
    5. Do not use decimal notation for unrelated results, even if they appear nearby in the text

    Required components for each addition:
    1. Clear connection to the immediately preceding content
    2. Proper LaTeX formatting for all mathematical expressions
    3. Consistent numbering scheme with existing content
    4. Preservation of notation and conventions
    5. Brief outline of proof strategy (when applicable)

    Types of additions to consider:
    - Natural extensions that follow directly from previous results
    - Supporting lemmas that bridge logical steps
    - Corollaries that highlight immediate consequences
    - Observations that clarify preceding concepts
    - Intermediate results needed for subsequent proofs
    - Classical results that connect naturally to the context
    - Alternative characterizations of recently defined concepts

    Requirements:
    1. NEVER modify or remove existing content
    2. Insert new content at logically appropriate locations
    3. Use clear markers or transitions for new additions
    4. Follow established notation and conventions
    5. Number new results consistently with surrounding content
    6. Provide explicit connections to nearby results
    7. Include proof strategies where appropriate
    8. Maintain document flow and readability
    9. Respect existing definitions and terminology
    10. Ensure logical progression of ideas
    11. Add <!-- END --> comment at the very end of the text after all content

    Please analyze this mathematical text and suggest logical extensions and additional results by integrating them naturally within the existing content:

    {content}

    Remember to:
    1. Keep all existing content unchanged
    2. Insert new material at appropriate locations when helpfull
    3. Use clear transitions between existing and new content
    4. Maintain consistent notation and formatting throughout 
    5. Add <!-- END --> comment at the very end of the text after all content
