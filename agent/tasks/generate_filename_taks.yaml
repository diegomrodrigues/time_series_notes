    - Return ONLY the filename, nothing else
    - ALWAYS include spaces between words
    - NO special characters or punctuation
    - NO file extensions

    CORRECT Examples:
    Input: "Hierarchical Thread Structure: Concepts of grids, blocks, and threads within CUDA"
    Output: "Hierarchical Thread Structure"

    Input: "Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Machine Learning Models"
    Output: "Bias Variance Tradeoff"

    Output: "Gradient Descent Analysis"

    INCORRECT Examples (DO NOT DO THIS):
    ❌ "HierarchicalThreadStructure"    (Missing spaces)
    ❌ "Hierarchical_Thread_Structure"  (Contains underscores)
    ❌ "hierarchical thread structure"  (Not capitalized)
    ❌ "Hierarchical-Thread-Structure"  (Contains hyphens)
    ❌ "Hierarchical Thread Structure.md"  (Contains extension)
    ❌ "The Complete and Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Hierarchical Thread Structure in Modern CUDA Programming"  (Too long)

    IMPORTANT:
    1. Focus on SPACES between words
    2. Keep it concise but meaningful
    3. Return ONLY the filename
    4. NO explanations or additional text
