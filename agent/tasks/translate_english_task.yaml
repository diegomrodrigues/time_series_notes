      - Code blocks and inline code
      - Special symbols and emojis (⚠️❗✔️💡)
      
    2. Preserve technical accuracy:
      - Keep programming terms in English when standard
      - Maintain mathematical notation exactly as is
      - Preserve all LaTeX commands unchanged
      
    3. Ensure consistent terminology:
      - Use established Portuguese technical terms when they exist
      - Keep English terms when they are the industry standard
      - Maintain consistency with previously translated terms
